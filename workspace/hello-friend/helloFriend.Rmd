My name is Sarah Ronchetti and I was born and raised in Kirkland, Washington. I grew up in a predominantly Catholic household while attending private and Catholic schools all the way up to my start at Washington State University. I feel as though this background truly shaped me into the person I am today and want to continue to be in my near future. I grew up with my mother, father, and younger sister, who all had a large impact on my life journey.

During my time in high school, I enjoyed many hobbies such as running cross country, and continuing my passion for art by taking courses such as AP Studio Art, which I thoroughly enjoyed. In addition, I also took AP computer science in high school, and fell in love with the course. This course lead me to the introduction of coding and learning Java as my first language. I enjoyed the coding exercises that we did during class and still use some of those tools in my classes today. With the drive for success and the competitive environment that I was placed in high school pushed me to accomplish more than I thought I ever could. After taking the course in high school it lead me to what to pursue computer science has a major in college. In my AP computer science course, I was given a lot of help from everyone around me especially my teacher. I would meet with him in his office twice a week at lunch to go over everything in the class that I was struggling with to gain a better understanding of the subject. As I started off in college majoring in computer science, I later realized that I wanted to incorporate more design into my life. I switched my major to software engineering and have been able to combine my love for design with coding. After my time in high school, I knew it was time for to start searching for a college to continue my education. I looked all around the US, and after a long search and much debate, I ended up choosing to start my freshman year at University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio where my grandfather attended. I wanted to experience a fresh start in a new state that I had never been before. With my grandfather's encouragement it lead me to want to try something new and out of my comfort zone.

During my time in Dayton, I met so many new people, experienced a new culture that I was very unfamiliar with and learned so many new life lessons. While I thought Dayton would be the perfect fit me for me, the school did not offer the right classes for the career path that I wanted to continue down. I also really missed my friends and family back home which had a large influence on my decision to transfer back to the northwest, to Washington State University. This decision was very difficult for me to make but I shortly discovered that this school was where I belonged. Washington State University offered the major that I wanted to pursue and learn, software engineering, to then be able to have the job of my dreams later on in my professional life. One of the biggest struggles that I faced going into this major was the overwhelming number of males compared to women in the STEM field. I really felt that I was a minority in all of my classes being sometimes the only woman and feeling like I was being looked down upon. I finally learned that this is the reality of being an engineering student and that I was just going to have to trust myself and others that I can do this and just because I was a female, it would have no impact on the work I could do compared to others. Staying focused on myself and the work I do, I was able to complete this major with other women by my side who also faced this same struggle. I hope that in the future, I can inspire more women into this major and into STEM majors as a whole because there is a very large male dominant presence in these fields. As a senior here at Washington State University, I am looking forward to finding my dream job as a web/mobile application developer, working at Apple, developing new software and UI within the company. I have had previous experience working in Swift after taking the mobile application development class at Washington State University. In this class I was exposed to a different type of coding that allowed me to work with the visualization of the UI and interact with the code at the same time. It allowed me to be creative and gave me a chance to bring my designs to life, which gave me the drive to want to learn more. After learning this language, I knew it was something I wanted to take further in my career and made it my goal to one day work for Apple. As I know I will not immediately get the job I want working with Swift right out of college, I know it will be possible in the future with more experience at hand. With this in mind, I know I have to continue my drive to work hard each and every day and know that this will be difficult, but I trust that I can do it if I set my mind to it. I have worked so hard in throughout my time in college and I know and trust in myself that I will continue this work ethic in my professional career.

My family has had such a large impact on my career and who I am today. One of the biggest impacts that this year had on me was the beginning of last semester, my mother passed away due to alcoholism. I have always had such a strong bond and connection with my mother and losing her completely changed my relationship with my family and made me focus on what I need to accomplish in life to make her proud. Dealing with the struggles of my mom’s health over the years really drove me to be independent and to accomplish my goals on my own. For example, back in 2018 I applied for several internships in the Seattle area. After going through several interviews and rejection letters, I finally got an interview with a company called CDK Global that hired me on the spot. It was my very first internship over the summer of 2018 where I originally learned how to code in the frontend. Going into this internship I was very nervous as I was only a sophomore in college and felt like I was not prepared enough. I ended up leading my team of interns in my group and ended up choosing the project that we worked on due to our mentor being laid off from the company. The project that I chose to lead, was to change and update their UI for purchasing vehicles from second- and third-party vendors. They even brought in the person who designed the original copy and had a meeting to explain how our implementation would be an improvement and beneficial to the company. The following year in 2019, I reapplied for the same internship and worked there again in the summer of 2019. The project for the interns during the summer of 2019 was to design a tool for other software engineers to use that would change and manipulate data. As I had a lot of fun creating the UI for the project, I knew it was what I wanted to do for my career and wanted to learn as much as I could during that time. Over the time I spent working at CDK, I met a lot of new friends and new coding skills that I apply in my classes and projects today. Unfortunately, for summer of 2020 I was unable to get an internship as the one I applied for and was accepted into could not support the funding for the interns and had to cancel the program due to COVID-19. I had to spend last summer working at Starbucks to make money for the next school year. As I am going to be graduating in May, I have been job searching the past 6 months have not decided on where I want to work or what I really want to do. I have contemplated continuing school to get my master’s in software engineering, but I also want to get a job and get started with my career.

Dealing with the obstacles I have been delt in life have made an impact as to who I am as a person and how I want my life to play out in the future. Not only do I know I have the support from my mom who is watching over me, but I also have a lot of support from my father and my friends. My father is another person in my life who has driven me to be the best version of myself that I can be. As he is also an engineer and constantly working with the people in my field, he gives me guidance as to what path that would be best for me to follow for my career. After watching my dad over the years work very hard and being able to support us throughout our lives has given me inspiration to fulfill the same life for my kids one day. I have realized it takes a lot of hard work and determination to want to reach the goals I have set for myself, but I am confident that one day they will be accomplished.
